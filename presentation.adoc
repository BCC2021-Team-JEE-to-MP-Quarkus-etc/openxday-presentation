From JEE to Microprofile to Quarkus

//:title-slide-background-color: #ff0000

== Motivation

[%step]
* Traditional App-Servers move to finer grained Services
* `lightweight` JEE with MicroProfile
* Clumsy dev-experience with classic JEE Apps
* Heard about cool things
** like Quarkus
** WildFly 25 with bootable-jar and MicroProfile Support

=== Codecamp Goals
[%step]
* Explore Quarkus and WildFly MicroProfile
* Candidates for the Baloise stack ?
* What needs to be migrated ?


== Concerns

[%step]

* Need to adapt all Java-Files.
* Need for proprietary Product-specific features like Annotations, Package-Imports.
* What happens when this cool hyped technology disappears in a few years?
* Are these technologies working with Baloise-specific Setups?

== Overview

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Technologie |PoC Description

|Quarkus
|Quarkus-starter with rest-endpoint and database-access

|Quarkus Native
|Quarkus-starter with rest-endpoint and database-access, native compiled

|WildFly 25 MP
|WildFly 25 MP with rest-endpoint and database-access, Bootable-jar

|WildFly 25 MP Native
|not available out of the box, could be achieved by huge manual effort

== Assessment Criteria

[%step]
- Developer experience
- Migration path for JEE-Apps
- Workload effects
- Oekosystem, Community, Perspectives
- Support Subscription

== Quarkus Demo

[%step]
- Quarkus dev-mode demonstrating short roundtrip times
- GitActions Workflow, Build-Steps, Container-Registry
- Demo-App served from OpenShift
- and: OpenShift Console App-Insights (Memory etc.)

== Comparison

- Developer experience
- Migration path for JEE-Apps
- Workload effects
- Oekosystem, Community, Perspectives
- Support Subscription

=== Developer Experience

Wildfly

[%step]
* Heavy configuration-effort compared to Quarkus or Spring
* Improved Dev-Experience (dev-mode) compared to classic JBoss standalone remote-debug.
* Short roundtrip (code, save, compile, redeploy, test) runs implicit after change of source-files.
* No Server-Restarts needed during code-changes.

=== Developer Experience

Quarkus

[%step]
* Minimal configuration-effort compared to JBoss/Wildfly (fully support for Config-Microprofile)
* Smooth Dev-Experience (dev-mode). Very short roundtrip (code, save, compile, redeploy, test) runs implicit after
  change of source-files.
* No Server-Restarts needed during code-changes.


=== Migration path for JEE-Apps

Wildfly

[%step]
* All JEE-Specs (jakartaee) are available +
(like jpa, hibernate, cdi, jax-rs)
* Therefore WildFly is a valuable migration-path-candidate for legacy JEE-apps
* Manually implemented features like +
health-checks, open-api, oidc, http-client, configuration 
can be replaced by Microprofile features


=== Migration path for JEE-Apps

Quarkus 1/2

[%step]
* Most important JEE-Specs (JakartaEE) are available +
(like jpa, hibernate, cdi, jax-rs)
* Therefore Quarkus is a valuable migration-path-candidate for legacy JEE-apps
* JEE-Features like @EJB, @Stateless etc, must be replaced by its corresponding implementations like CDI.
* Manually implemented features like health-checks, open-api, oidc, http-client, configuration
  can be replaced by Microprofile features.

=== Migration path for JEE-Apps

Quarkus 2/2

[%step]
* Provides both: `classic jvm` and `native binary` -mode
* Classic mode supports even dynamic code like reflection, Class.forName() etc.
* Native mode is limited. Quarkus-Extensions addresses this limitation.
  Most used APIs/libraries are available already and the number of extensions is growing fast

=== Workload effects

Wildfly

[%step]
* Optimized packaging leads to reduced footprint, but still starting from 200Mi+
* Supports layered image-creation


=== Workload effects

Quarkus

[%step]
* Optimized Java-Runtime for containerized usage (even in non-native mode)
* Ready to serve fast starting serverless-functions (Knative etc.)
* Native-Mode designed for short living processes (minimal memory-footprint)
* Long-living processes in classic jvm-mode can outperform native-mode in terms of optimized memory-management

=== Ecosystem

Wildfly

[%step]
* Small community, a few Core-Committers
* Well curated documentation
* WildFly seems to be very early adopter of MicroProfile Implementations 

=== Ecosystem

Quarkus

[%step]
* Decoupled from Oracle GraalVM by integrating relevant features into OpenJDK
* Growing ecosystem supported by curated documentation of how to implement Quarkus-Extensions
* Quarkus-Extensions for Spring Data and more is, or will be available
* Keycloak will be ported to Quarkus-Native distribution

== Conclusion

* Excited about quarkus.
* Try to port some non-critical Baloise Apps to Quarkus to collect more experiences.
